# MIXChar

**Purpose**

An academic Java project to demonstrate my proficiency in Object Oriented Programming, as of December 2023.

This project does the following:

- Obtains and validates user input from the terminal
- Converts each char of the input into its MIXChar representation
- Packs the characters into unsigned longs, 11 characters per long
- Prints the unsigned longs to the console
- Unpacks the unsigned long, coverts each char back to UTF-8, and prints the message (the original input) to the console
